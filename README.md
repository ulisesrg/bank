# Digital Hub Frontend Assignment

This project is an assignment for a job position as a Frontend Developer. It is a simulation of an online banking system where you can log-in and log-out. Once you are logged in, you can transfer money from your accounts to other accounts and see how your balance is affected.

It was build with React because it was part of the assignment and because of the capabilites of that framework.

This app was developed with Flux architecture, through Redux (and React-Redux). The main reason of doing that is that it allows me to trace changes during development simpler (for me) and I found it very useful to simulate an API call (and its data) using an initial state. Also, there are no post methods to an API because all the actions are simulated through Redux.

ApexCharts was used to obtain the pie charts. It is an open-source charts library for frontend development.

The project was not completed before the deadline (Friday Aptil 10th). The login page still needed an user validation to be completed and some parts of the code could be refactored. However, the project is still being improved after that date.
