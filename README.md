This project is an assignment for a job position as a Frontend Developer. It is a simulation of an online banking system where you can log-in and log-out. Once you are logged in, you can transfer money from your accounts to other accounts and see how your balance is affected.

It was build with React because it was part of the assignment and because of the capabilites of that framework.

This app was developed with Flux architecture, through Redux (and Reac-Redux). The main reason of doing that is that it allows to trace changes during development simpler for me and I found it very useful to simulate an API call (and its data) using an initial state. Also, there are no posth methods to an API because it was all the actions are simulated through Redux.

This project is not completed yet but this is as far as I could do before the deadline. The login page is not still needs an user validation system to be completed and I know that some parts of the code can still be improved.
